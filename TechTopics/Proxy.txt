Forward Proxy :- 
It is used as guardian of the private networks. When these private networks want to fetch data from internet, forward proxy does it on their behalf.
This blocks harmful websites and hides the ip address of the private network by using its own ipaddr instead.


Private ip :- priv ip

              priv ip
Computer <------------------
              priv ip      |           
Computer <----------->  Forward Proxy <--------> Internet
	      priv ip      |           Proxy ip
