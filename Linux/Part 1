RHEL Familily - Red Hat Enterprise Linux. It heads the CentOS, CentsOS Stream, Fedora and Oracle Linux

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Some of the key facts about the Red Hat distribution family are:

Fedora serves as an upstream testing platform for RHEL.
CentOS is a close clone of R	; in fact, CentOS has been part of Red Hat since 2014.
A heavily patched version 4.18 kernel is used in RHEL/CentOS 8 Stream, while version 5.14 is used in RHEL/CentOS 9 Stream.
It supports multiple hardware platforms.
It uses dnf, the RPM-based package manager (covered in detail later) to install, update, and remove packages in the system.
RHEL is widely used by enterprises which host their own systems.

The relationship between SUSE  (SUSE Linux Enterprise Server, or SLES) and openSUSE is similar to the one described between RHEL, CentOS, and Fedora.

The Debian Family --- The Debian distribution is upstream for several other distributions, including Ubuntu. In turn, Ubuntu is upstream for Linux Mint and a number of other distributions. It is commonly used on both servers and desktop computers. Debian is a pure open source community project (not owned by any corporation) and has a strong focus on stability.

Ubuntu has been widely used for cloud deployments.
